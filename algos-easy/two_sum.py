# Two Sum

# Write a function, two_sum, that takes in a list and a target sum as arguments. 
# The function should return a tuple containing a two of indices whose elements sum to the given target. 
# The indices returned must be unique.
# Be sure to return the indices, not the elements themselves.
# There is guaranteed to be one such two that sums to the target.


def two_sum(numbers, target_sum):
    # for i in range(len(numbers)):
    #     for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)):
    #         if numbers[i] + numbers[j] == target_sum:
    #             return(i,j)
    
    # Enhanced solution using HASH 
    hash = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(numbers):
        complement = target_sum - num
        # print Hash
        if complement in hash:
            return (hash[complement], i)
        else:
            hash[num] = i
